Weka is free open source software. It is written in Java and can run on any platform that supports Java, including:

    Windows.
    Mac OS X.
    Linux.

You can download Weka as standalone software or as a version bundled with Java.

If you do not already have Java installed on your system, I recommend downloading and installing a version bundled with Java.

Your task for this lesson is to visit the `Weka download page`_, download and install Weka on your workstation.

In the next lesson, you will discover how to load standard machine learning datasets.
